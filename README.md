Team Members:

our program will take two parameters: "inputfiles" "outputfiles"
The first argument specifies the path to read input text files
The second argument specifies the path to write output files

The directory "inputfiles" contains test files in the same directory of the executable adb.jar
The directory "outputfiles" in the same directory of the executable adb.jar contains the output write

Follow the instructions of reprounzip to unzip the ml6389_jy3555.rpz file
Please note that to unzip the .rpz file, we need GLIBC version 2.27, however, when I tested,
I found CIMS has GLIBC version 2.17.
